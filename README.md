The Employee Management System is a Spring Boot-based application designed to manage employee data efficiently. The system utilizes MySQL for storing employee records, Apache Kafka for asynchronous processing of employee hobbies, and gRPC for high-performance communication between services.

Features:
Employee Management: Perform CRUD operations to manage employee data.
Hobby Management: Add employee hobbies asynchronously using Kafka for decoupled and scalable processing.
MySQL Integration: Store employee data and associated hobbies in a relational database.
gRPC APIs: Provide high-performance communication between microservices.
Asynchronous Processing: Use Kafka to handle hobby addition requests without blocking the main application flow.
Error Handling: Ensure resilience with robust exception handling for synchronous and asynchronous operations.
Key Technologies:
Spring Boot: Backend framework for building scalable and maintainable applications.
MySQL: Relational database for structured data storage.
Apache Kafka: Handles asynchronous hobby addition for scalability and improved user experience.
gRPC: Enables high-performance communication between different system components.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database interactions.
Spring Kafka: Seamless integration with Kafka for producing and consuming hobby-related messages.
Protobuf: Defines gRPC service interfaces and message formats.
Workflow:
Employee Data Management:
CRUD operations for employee data are performed synchronously and stored in MySQL.
Adding Hobbies Asynchronously:
When a user adds hobbies for an employee, a Kafka message is produced and sent to the hobby topic.
A separate consumer processes the hobby messages and updates the employeeâ€™s hobbies in the database.
Use Case:
This project is ideal for organizations needing a scalable employee management solution. Kafka ensures that hobby addition requests are processed asynchronously, reducing delays and maintaining a responsive system. The use of gRPC ensures efficient inter-service communication, making it suitable for modern microservices-based architectures.
